#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
#     For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].

# numbers = [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3]
# twenty = numbers.select do |number|
#   number < 20 
# end 
# p twenty

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
#     For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].

# strings = ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"]
# w = strings.select do |words| 
# words[0] == "w"
# end 
# p w


#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].

# hashes = [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}]

# prices = hashes.select do |price|
#   price[:price] > 5
# end 
# p prices 
#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].


#  numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]
#  evens = numbers.select do |number|
#   number.even?  
#  end 
#  p evens 

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings shorter than 4 letters.
#     For example, ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"] becomes ["a", "man", "a", "a"].

strings = ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"]
four = strings.select do |letters|
  letters.length < 4
end 
p four    


#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with names shorter than 6 letters (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "book", price: 4}].


#  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 10.
#     For example, [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3] becomes [8, 0, 3].




#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].



#  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].


# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].
