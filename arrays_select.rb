#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
#     For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].

# numbers = [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3]
# less_than = []
# numbers.each do |smaller|
#   if smaller < 20 
#     less_than << smaller
#   end 
# end 

# p less_than

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
#     For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].

# all = ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"]

# only_w = []

# all.each do |strings|
#   if strings[0].chr == "w"
#     only_w << strings
#   end 
# end 
# p only_w

#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].

# items = [
#   {name: "chair", price: 100}, 
#   {name: "pencil", price: 1}, 
#   {name: "book", price: 4}
# ] 

# items.map do |greater_than_5|
#   if greater_than_5[:price] > 5 
#     p greater_than_5
#   end 
# end 


#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].

# numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7]
# numbers.map do |even_only|
#   if even_only % 2 == 0 
#     p even_only
#   end 
# end 

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings shorter than 4 letters.
#     For example, ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"] becomes ["a", "man", "a", "a"].

strings = ["abcde", "abcd", "abc", "ab", "a"]
strings.map do |four_letters|
  if four_letters.length  4
    p four_letters
  end 
end 

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with names shorter than 6 letters (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

#  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 10.
#     For example, [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3] becomes [8, 0, 3].

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].
